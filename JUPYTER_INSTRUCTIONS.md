# 🎉 Jupyter Lab Environment is Ready!

## ✅ Jupyter Lab is Running

Your Jupyter Lab server is now running at:

**URL:** http://localhost:8888/lab?token=7afe253c83a96edc1010737ed9a747f0de99f3851f654b38

## 📝 How to Access

1. **Copy the URL above** and paste it into your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
2. The Jupyter Lab interface will open
3. You'll see your project files in the left sidebar

## 📓 Open the Notebook

1. In Jupyter Lab, navigate to the file browser on the left
2. Click on **`anti_overfitting_training.ipynb`** to open it
3. The notebook will open with all the cells ready to run

## ▶️ Run the Notebook Cell by Cell

### Method 1: Run Each Cell Individually
- Click on a cell to select it
- Press **Shift + Enter** to run the cell and move to the next one
- Or click the ▶️ (Play) button in the toolbar

### Method 2: Run All Cells
- Click **Run** menu → **Run All Cells**
- This will execute all cells from top to bottom

### Method 3: Run Selected Cells
- Select multiple cells (hold Shift and click)
- Press **Shift + Enter** or click the ▶️ button

## 📊 What the Notebook Does

The notebook contains these sections:
1. **Import Libraries** - Load all required packages
2. **GPU Setup** - Check if GPU is available
3. **Data Augmentation** - Configure heavy augmentation to prevent overfitting
4. **DWT Feature Extraction** - Define wavelet transform function
5. **Dataset Class** - Load deepfake and original images
6. **Model Architecture** - Two-branch EfficientNet with regularization
7. **Helper Functions** - Early stopping and evaluation functions
8. **Load Dataset** - Prepare train/val/test splits
9. **Initialize Training** - Setup optimizer, scheduler, loss function
10. **Training Loop** - Train the model with anti-overfitting techniques
11. **Final Evaluation** - Test the model and show metrics
12. **Visualizations** - Generate training plots
13. **Summary** - Display final results

## 💡 Tips

- **Watch the Progress**: Each cell will show output as it runs
- **Training Time**: The training loop (Cell 11) will take the longest (could be 30-60 minutes depending on your GPU)
- **Interrupt Execution**: Click the ⏹️ (Stop) button if you need to stop a cell
- **Restart Kernel**: If something goes wrong, go to **Kernel** → **Restart Kernel**

## 📈 Expected Results

After training completes, you'll see:
- Training and validation loss/accuracy curves
- Overfitting analysis (train-val gap)
- Confusion matrix
- Final test accuracy (target: >85%)
- Model saved as `anti_overfitting_model.pth`
- Visualization saved as `training_results.png`

## 🛑 Stop Jupyter Lab

When you're done:
1. Close the browser tab
2. In your terminal/command prompt, press **Ctrl+C** twice
3. Or just close the terminal window

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**If cells fail:**
- Make sure the dataset directories exist:
  - `deeplearning/Deepfake/extracted_faces`
  - `deeplearning/Original/extracted_faces`
- Check that all required packages are installed
- Restart the kernel and try again

**If GPU is not detected:**
- The model will still work on CPU (just slower)
- Make sure CUDA is installed if you have an NVIDIA GPU

## 🎯 Ready to Start!

Open the URL in your browser and start running the cells one by one to train your anti-overfitting deepfake detection model!

**Happy Training! 🚀**
